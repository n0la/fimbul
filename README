fimbul Copyright (C) 2014 by Florian Stinglmayr <florian_AT_n0la_DOT_.org>

fimbul aims to be a Pen & Paper framework to make the life of the dungeon
master (DM) easier. It is setup and designed to work with a folder
containing everything related to your current campaign. It stores
every information it needs hidden away, but the main goal is that you
are in control of everything. All information and configuration is
stored in easily edited YAML format for your text editing pleasure.

fimbul is currently under heavy development, and many features are
either missing, or subject to change.

Furthermore fimbul is licenced under the GPLv2 (or any later version
of of the licence) licence and thus free and open source software.
Note that many information this framework may use are perhaps under
different licences, for example the d20srd is under the Open Gaming
Licence.
