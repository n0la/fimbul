TODO
----

 * There is currently little documentation and very few unit tests.
 * The calendar functionality was added but has since been neglected. It
   requires an easy interface to move the current date forward, do
   calculations and add notes to past and future dates for easy campaign
   management.
 * There are currently very little command line utilities and/or GUI
   functions to help with a day to day campaign management. Tedious, or
   error prone tasks should be handled by the {C,G}CI
 * The whole thing currently only works on Linux and/or *BSD. Windows
   support would be nice.

TODO v35
--------

 * The item infrastructure currently only supports  Armour, shields,
   and weapons. This should be fixed to include wands, goggles, belts,
   and so forth. No special subclass should be needed for those items,
   just use `fimbul.v35.magical_item`.
 * The abilities currently do not support spells that are either a must
   or optional. Just like with the synergy requirements, restructure the
   `spells' array into a structure containing `allof' and/or `oneof'.
 * Crafting currently does not take spell cost into factor (especially
   with expensive spells like `Wish' or `Miracle'). This is due to
   missing spell information.
 * Encounters have been abandoned because currently its far easier to
   do encounters on paper. With more functions, a complete d20srd
   monster library, and an easy intuitive GUI this should be the core
   functionality of fimbul.
